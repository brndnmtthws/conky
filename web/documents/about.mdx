Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on torsmo. Since its
inception, Conky has changed significantly from its predecessor, while
maintaining simplicity and configurability. Conky can display just about
anything, either on your root desktop or in its own window. Not only
does Conky have many built-in objects, it can also display just about
any piece of information by using scripts and other external programs.

Conky has more than 250 built in objects, including support for a
plethora of OS stats (uname, uptime, CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage,
\"top\" like process stats, and network monitoring, just to name a few),
built in IMAP and POP3 support, built in support for many popular music
players (MPD, XMMS2, Audacious), and much much more. Conky can display
this info either as text, or using simple progress bars and graph
widgets, with different fonts and colours.
