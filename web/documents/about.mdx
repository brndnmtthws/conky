Conky is a system monitor for X. Conky can display just about anything, either
on your root desktop or in its own window. Not only does Conky have many
built-in objects, it can also display just about any piece of information by
using scripts and other external programs.

Conky has more than 250 built in objects, including support for a plethora of OS
stats (uname, uptime, CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage, `top` like process
stats, and network monitoring, just to name a few), built in IMAP and POP3
support, built in support for many popular music players (MPD, XMMS2,
Audacious), and much much more. Conky can display this info either as text, or
using simple progress bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.
