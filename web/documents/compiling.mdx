Using CMake to build Conky is pretty easy, and here is how I do it:

1. From the top level source dir, create a build working dir, and cd into it

```shell-session
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

2. Run the cmake configuration process

```shell-session
$ cmake ../ # pass the path to the sources to cmake
```

OR

```shell-session
$ ccmake ../ # you can also use the fance curses interface, or try cmake-gui
```

3. Compile as usual, and enjoy the out-of-source goodness

```shell-session
$ make
# make install # if you want
```

There are a number of build options for Conky, and the best way to discover
them is to use the `ccmake` (or `cmake-gui`) CMake tool for browsing them.

Certain Conky build time features (such as doc generation) require third-party
applications, which you should be notified of via CMake. In the case of doc
generation, you'll need the docbook2X package (available on most
distributions).
