        ## Getting a stack trace

        If you are reporting a crash, please attach a stack trace below.

        To create one with `gdb`, try the following steps:

        ```shell
        # Start 'conky'
        $ gdb conky

        # Run 'conky' with a config.
        (gdb) run -c ~/.your_conky.conf

        # Wait for a crash to occur, then run this.
        (gdb) bt full

        # ... stack trace output here ...
        ```
