 *
 * Important note: if more than one exec callback uses the same command,
 * then only ONE callback is actually stored. This saves space. However,
 * suppose we have the following ${exec} objects in our conky.text:
 *
 * ${exec ~/bin/foo.sh}
 * ${execi 10 ~/bin/foo.sh}
 *
 * To the callback system, these are identical! Furthermore, the callback
 * with the smallest period/interval is the one that is stored. So the execi
 * command will in fact run on every update interval, rather than every
 * ten seconds as one would expect.
