 * Type trait that tells whether a container stores its data inside the object or inside allocated

 *
 * Per default the trait assumes any type to store its data outside, on the heap. The only types
 * where it knows that the storage is inside the object are std::array, Vc::array, and T[] (builtin
 * arrays).
 *
 * The trait forwards the actual decision to has_no_allocated_data_impl, but removes const/volatile
 * and references from the type \p T to make the number of required specializations of
 * has_no_allocated_data_impl minimal.
