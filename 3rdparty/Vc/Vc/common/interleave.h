/** \ingroup Utilities
 Interleaves the entries from \p a and \p b into two vectors of the same type. The order
 in the returned vector contains the elements `a[0], b[0], a[1], b[1], a[2], b[2], a[3],
 b[3], ...`.

Example:
\code
Vc::SimdArray<int, 4> a = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
Vc::SimdArray<int, 4> b = { 9, 8, 7, 6 };
std::tie(a, b) = Vc::interleave(a, b);
std::cout << a << b;
// prints:
// <1 9 2 8><3 7 4 6>
\endcode

 \param a input vector whose data will appear at even indexes in the output
 \param b input vector whose data will appear at odd indexes in the output
 \return two vectors with data from \p a and \p b interleaved
