 * Function to mimic the ternary operator '?:' (inline-if).
 *
 * \param condition  Determines which values are returned. This is analog to the first argument to
 *                   the ternary operator.
 * \param trueValue  The values to return where \p condition is \c true.
 * \param falseValue The values to return where \p condition is \c false.
 * \return A combination of entries from \p trueValue and \p falseValue, according to \p condition.
 *
 * So instead of the scalar variant
 * \code
 * float x = a > 1.f ? b : b + c;
 * \endcode
 * you'd write
 * \code
 * float_v x = Vc::iif (a > 1.f, b, b + c);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Assuming \c a has the values [0, 3, 5, 1], \c b is [1, 1, 1, 1], and \c c is [1, 2, 3, 4], then x
 * will be [2, 2, 3, 5].
