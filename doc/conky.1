conky \- A system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but more kickass. It just keeps on given'er. Yeah.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code. 
Since it's original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from it's predecessor. 
Conky can display just about anything, either on your root desktop or in it's own window. 
Conky has many built-in objects, as well as the ability to execute programs and scripts, 
then display the output from stdout.
.PP
We are always looking for help, and anyone interested in becoming a developer is welcome. 
Please use the facilities at SourceForge to make bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.
.PP
Thanks for your interest in Conky.
.SH COMPILING
For users compiling from source, make sure you have the X development libraries installed. 
This should be a package along the lines of "libx11-dev or xorg-x11-dev". 
.PP
Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app-admin/conky" for installation.
There is also usually an up-to-date ebuild within Conky's package or in Svn.
.PP
Debian,etc. users -- Conky will be in Debian's repositories soon (by mid-September, hopefully), and then 
Ubuntu shortly thereafter. Until then, "dpkg -i" the .deb package to install. 
.PP
Example to compile and run Conky with all optional components (note that some configure options may differ for your system):
.TP 
\fBsh autogen.sh\fR \fB# Only required if building from Svn\fR 
.TP 
\fB\&./configure \fR\fB\-\-prefix=/usr \-\-mandir=/usr/share/man \-\-infodir=/usr/share/info \-\-datadir=/usr/share \-\-sysconfdir=/etc \-\-localstatedir=/var/lib \-\-enable\-xft \-\-enable\-seti \-\-enable\-double\-buffer \-\-enable\-own\-window \-\-enable\-proc\-uptime \-\-enable\-mpd \-\-enable\-mldonkey \-\-enable\-x11 \-\-enable\-portmon \-\-enable\-xmms \-\-enable\-bmp \-\-enable\-audacious \-\-enable\-infopipe \-\-enable\-bmpx \fR
.TP

.TP 
\fBmake install\fR \fB# Optional\fR

\fBsrc/conky\fR 
.PP
Conky probably doesn't compile with compilers other than gcc and icc. 
It doesn't compile with C89 compiler and not even with pure C99.
It uses a few things that might not exist: strdup(), strcasecmp(), strncasecmp(), 
optarg variable with getopt() and long long (not in C89). Crashes in file system
statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I don't know exactly why.
.PP
You can disable 'drawing to own window' feature in case you don't need it by passing 
--disable-own-window to configure -script.
.PP
.SH "YOU SHOULD KNOW"
Conky is generally very good on resources. However, certain objects in
Conky are harder on resources then others. In particular, the $tail,
$top, $font, and $graph objects are quite costly in comparison to the rest of Conky.
.PP
If you do use them, please do not complain about memory or CPU usage, 
unless you think something's seriously wrong (mem leak, etc.).
.PP
An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1 conky".
Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.
.PP
IMPORTANT: For previous Conky users, Conky 1.3 no longer supports the metar stuff. 
mdsplib was causing way too many problems. Hopefully there'll be a better solution in Conky 2.x...

\fBtcp_portmon\fR \fBport_begin port_end item (index)\fR \fI(ip4 only at present)\fR 
TCP port monitor for specified local ports. Port numbers must be in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

count - total number of connections in the range

rip - remote ip address

rhost - remote host name 

rport - remote port number

rservice - remote service name from /etc/services

lip - local ip address

lhost - local host name

lport - local port number

lservice - local service name from /etc/services

The connection index provides you with access to each connection in the port monitor. The monitor will return information for index values from 0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are simply ignored. For the "count" item, the connection index must be omitted. It is required for all other items.

Examples:

${tcp_portmon 6881 6999 count} -
displays the number of connections in the bittorrent port range

${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0} -
displays the remote host ip of the first sshd connection

${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 9} -
displays the remote host ip of the tenth sshd connection

${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0} -
displays the remote host name of the first connection on a privileged port

${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4} -
displays the remote host port of the fifth connection on a privileged port

${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14} -
displays the local service name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports

Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a single port range for different items and different indexes all use the same monitor internally. In other words, the program avoids creating redundant monitors. 
.TP 
\fBtexeci\fR \fBinterval command\fR 
Runs a command at an interval inside a thread and displays the output. Same as $execi, except the command is run inside a thread. Use this if you have a slow script to keep Conky updating. You should make the interval slightly longer then the time it takes your script to execute. For example, if you have a script that take 5 seconds to execute, you should make the interval at least 6 seconds. See also $execi.

.TP 
\fBoffset\fR \fB(pixels)\fR 
Move text over by N pixels. See also $voffset.

.TP 
\fBtail\fR \fBlogfile lines (interval)\fR 
Displays last N lines of supplied text text file. If interval is not supplied, Conky assumes 2x Conky's interval. Max of 30 lines can be displayed, or until the text buffer is filled.

.TP 
\fBtime\fR \fB(format)\fR 
Local time, see man strftime to get more information about format

.TP 
\fBtotaldown\fR \fBnet\fR 
Total download, overflows at 4 GB on Linux with 32-bit arch and there doesn't seem to be a way to know how many times it has already done that before conky has started.

.TP 
\fBtop\fR \fBtype, num\fR 
This takes arguments in the form:top (name) (number) Basically, processes are ranked from highest to lowest in terms of cpu usage, which is what (num) represents. The types are: "name", "pid", "cpu", and "mem". There can be a max of 10 processes listed.

.TP 
\fBtop_mem\fR \fBtype, num\fR 
Same as top, except sorted by mem usage instead of cpu

.TP 
\fBtotalup\fR \fBnet\fR 
Total upload, this one too, may overflow

.TP 
\fBupdates\fR \fBNumber of updates\fR 
for debugging

.TP 
\fBupspeed\fR \fBnet\fR 
Upload speed in kilobytes

.TP 
\fBupspeedf\fR \fBnet\fR 
Upload speed in kilobytes with one decimal

.TP 
\fBupspeedgraph\fR \fBnet (height),(width) (gradient colour 1) (gradient colour 2) (scale)\fR 
Upload speed graph, colours defined in hex, minus the #. If scale is non-zero, it becomes the scale for the graph.

.TP 
\fBvoffset\fR \fB(pixels)\fR 
Change vertical offset by N pixels. Negative values will cause text to overlap. See also $offset.

.TP 
\fBvoltage_mv\fR \fB(n)\fR 
Returns CPU #n's voltage in mV. CPUs are
counted from 1. If omitted, the parameter
defaults to 1. 

.TP 
\fBvoltage_v\fR \fB(n)\fR 
Returns CPU #n's voltage in V. CPUs are
counted from 1. If omitted, the parameter
defaults to 1.

.SH BUGS
Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with 
all window managers. Especially doesn't work well with Gnome and it has 
been reported that it doesn't work with KDE either. Nautilus can be 
disabled from drawing to desktop with program gconf-editor. Uncheck 
show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/. There is -w switch in Conky 
to set some specific window id. You might find xwininfo -tree useful to 
find the window to draw to. You can also use -o argument which makes
Conky to create its own window.
