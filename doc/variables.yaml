  To configure what Conky displays, you must supply some variables in the
  `conky.text` section of your configuration. In this secton you'll find a
  listing of the available variables. Some of them may require build options to
  be enabled at compile time for them to work.

  Colours are parsed using `XParseColor()`, there might be a list of them:
  `/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt`. Colour can be also in `#rrggbb` format (hex).

  Some objects may create threads, and sometimes these threads will not be
  destroyed until Conky terminates. There is no way to destroy or clean up
  threads while Conky is running. For example, if you use an MPD variable,
  the MPD thread will keep running until Conky dies. Some threaded objects
  will use one of the parameters as a `key`, so that you only have 1
  relevant thread running (for example, the $curl, and $rss
  objects launch one thread per URI).

  Optional arguments are generally denoted with paretheses (i.e., `(optional)`).

      Draws a horizontally scrolling graph with values from 0-100 plotted on the
      vertical axis. All parameters following the command are optional. Gradient
      colors can be specified as hexadecimal values with no 0x or # prefix. Use
      the -t switch to enable a temperature gradient, so that small values are
      "cold" with color 1 and large values are "hot" with color 2. Without the -t
      switch, the colors produce a horizontal gradient spanning the width of the
      graph. The scale parameter defines the maximum value of the graph.  Use the
      -l switch to enable a logarithmic scale, which helps to see small values.
      The default size for graphs can be controlled via the default_graph_height
      and default_graph_width config settings.

      If you need to execute a command with spaces, you have a
      couple options:

      1. wrap your command in double-quotes, or
      2. put your command into a separate file, such as ~/bin/myscript.sh, and use
      that as your execgraph command.

      Remember to make your script executable!

      In the following example, we set up execgraph to display seconds (0-59) on a
      graph that is 50px high and 200px wide, using a temperature gradient with
      colors ranging from red for small values (FF0000) to yellow for large values
      (FFFF00). We set the scale to 60.

      output of $execp every time Conky loops, and then destroys all the
      objects. If you try to use anything like $execi within an $execp
      statement, it will functionally run at the same interval that the
      $execp statement runs, as it is created and destroyed at every
      interval.

      characters are not part of the output, \w,\d,\h,\m,\s,\(,\) and \\ are
      replaced by weeks,days,hours,minutes,seconds,(,) and \. If you leave out a
      unit, it's value will be expressed in the highest unit lower than the one
      left out. Text between ()-chars will not be visible if a replaced unit in
      this text is 0. If seconds is a decimal number then you can see the
      numbers behind the point by using \S followed by a number that specifies
      the amount of digits behind the point that you want to see (maximum 9).
      You can also place a 'x' behind \S so you have all digits behind the point
      and no trailing zero's. (also maximum 9).

      Renders an image from the path specified using Imlib2. Takes

      of the image, and changing the WxH will scale the image. If you
      specify the no-cache flag (-n), the image will not be cached.
      Alternately, you can specify the -f int switch to specify a cache
      flush interval for a particular image. Example: ${image

      voltage; `fan` meaning fan; `temp` meaning temperature. Parameter n is
      number of the sensor. See `/sys/bus/platform/devices/` on your local
      computer. The optional arguments `factor` and `offset` allow precalculation
      of the raw input, which is being modified as follows: `input = input *
      factor + offset`. Note that they have to be given as decimal values (i.e.

      'step' is optional and defaults to 1 if not set. 'direction' is
      optional and defaults to left if not set. When direction is 'wait'
      then text will scroll left and wait for 'interval' itertations at the
      beginning and end of the text. If a var creates output on multiple
      lines then the lines are placed behind each other separated with a
      '|'-sign. If you change the textcolor inside $scroll it will
      automatically have it's old value back at the end of $scroll. The end

      Prints info regarding System Integrity Protection (SIP) on
      macOS. If no switch is provided, prints SIP status (enabled /
      disabled), else, status of the specific SIP feature corresponding to
      the switch provided.

      Below are shown the available switches:

      | SWITCH | RESULT                      | STATUS |
      |--------|-----------------------------|--------|
      | 0      | apple internal              | YES/NO |
      | 1      | forbid untrusted kexts      | YES/NO |
      | 2      | forbid task-for-pid         | YES/NO |
      | 3      | restrict filesystem         | YES/NO |

      | 8      | forbid any-recovery-os      | YES/NO |
      | 9      | forbid user-approved-kexts  | YES/NO |

      uses unsupported configuration?: If yes, prints "unsupported
      configuration, beware!" Else, prints "configuration is ok".

      USAGE:
      ```
      $ conky -t '${sip_status}'
      # print SIP status
      $ conky -t '${sip_status 0}'
      # print allows apple-internal? Yes or No?
      ```

      NOTES:

      * Available for all macOS versions (even the ones prior El Capitan where
      SIP was first introduced)
      * If run on versions prior El Capitan SIP is unavailable, so all you will
      get is "unsupported".

      Displays the number of microseconds it takes to get a reply
      on a ping to to tcp 'port' on 'host'. 'port' is optional and has 80 as
      default. This works on both open and closed ports, just make sure that
      the port is not behind a firewall or you will get 'down' as answer.
      It's best to test a closed port instead of an open port, you will get
      a quicker response.
    args:

  - name: tcp_portmon
    desc: |-
      TCP port (both IPv6 and IPv4) monitor for specified local ports.
      Port numbers must be in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

      | Item       | Description                              |
      |------------|------------------------------------------|
      | `count`    | Total number of connections in the range |
      | `rip`      | Remote ip address                        |
      | `rhost`    | Remote host name                         |
      | `rport`    | Remote port number                       |
      | `rservice` | Remote service name from `/etc/services` |
      | `lip`      | Local ip address                         |
      | `lhost`    | Local host name                          |
      | `lport`    | Local port number                        |
      | `lservice` | Local service name from `/etc/services`  |

      The connection index provides you with access to each connection in the
      port monitor. The monitor will return information for index values from
      0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are simply ignored. For the
      `count` item, the connection index must be omitted. It is required for
      all other items.

      Examples:

      | Example                              | Description                                                                           |
      |--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | `${tcp_portmon 6881 6999 count}`     | Displays the number of connections in the bittorrent port range                       |
      | `${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0}`         | Displays the remote host ip of the first sshd connection                              |
      | `${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 9}`         | Displays the remote host ip of the tenth sshd connection                              |
      | `${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0}`      | Displays the remote host name of the first connection on a privileged port            |
      | `${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4}`      | Displays the remote host port of the fifth connection on a privileged port            |
      | `${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14}` | Displays the local service name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports |

      Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range
      actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a single port
      range for different items and different indexes all use the same monitor
      internally. In other words, the program avoids creating redundant
      monitors.
    args:
      - port_begin
      - port_end
      - item
      - (index)
  - name: templateN
    desc: |-
      Evaluate the content of the templateN configuration variable (where
      N is a value between 0 and 9, inclusively), applying substitutions
      as described in the documentation of the corresponding configuration
      variable. The number of arguments is optional, but must match the
      highest referred index in the template. You can use the same special
      sequences in each argument as the ones valid for a template
      definition, e.g. to allow an argument to contain a whitespace. Also
      simple nesting of templates is possible this way.

      Here are some examples of template definitions, note they are placed
      between `[[ ... ]]` instead of ` ... `:

      ```lua
      template0 = [[$12]]
      template1 = [[1: ${fs_used 2} / ${fs_size 2}]]
      template2 = [[1 2]]
      ```

      The following list shows sample usage of the templates defined above,
      with the equivalent syntax when not using any template at all:

      | Using template                                | Same without template                      |

      | `${template1 root /}`                         | `root: ${fs_free /} / ${fs_size /}`        |
      | `${template1 ${template2 disk root} /}`       | `disk root: ${fs_free /} / ${fs_size /}`   |

      Runs a command at an interval inside a thread and displays
      the output. Same as $execi, except the command is run inside a thread.
      Use this if you have a slow script to keep Conky updating. You should
      make the interval slightly longer than the time it takes your script
      to execute. For example, if you have a script that take 5 seconds to
      execute, you should make the interval at least 6 seconds. See also
      $execi. This object will clean up the thread when it is destroyed, so
      it can safely be used in a nested fashion, though it may not produce
      the desired behaviour if used this way.
