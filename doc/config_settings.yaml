desc: |-
  This is a listing of global configuration options for Conky. These are placed
  in the `conky.config` section of your configuration file, before `conky.text`.

  The default configuration file location is `~/.config/conky/conky.conf` or
  `${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf`. On most systems, `$sysconfdir` is `/etc`,
  and you can find the sample config file there in
  `/etc/conky/conky.conf`.

  You might want to copy the default config to `~/.config/conky/conky.conf` and
  then start modifying it. User configs can be found at
  https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Configs.

  Optional arguments are generally denoted with paretheses (i.e., `(optional)`).

      Boolean, use ARGB visual? ARGB can be used for real
      transparency, note that a composite manager is required for real
      transparency. This option will not work as desired (in most cases) in
      conjunction with 'own_window_type override'.
  - name: own_window_class
    desc: Manually set the WM_CLASS name.
    default: Conky
  - name: own_window_colour
    desc: |-
      If own_window_transparent no, set a specified background
      colour. Takes either a hex value (e.g. '#ffffff'),
      a shorthand hex value (e.g. '#fff'), or a valid RGB nam

      - seconds
  - name: own_window_hints
    desc: |-
      If own_window is yes, you may use these window manager hints
      to affect the way Conky displays. Notes: Use own_window_type desktop

      own_window_type override, window manager hints have no meaning and are
      ignored.

  - name: own_window_type
    desc: |-
      if own_window is yes, you may specify type normal, desktop,
      dock, panel or override. Desktop windows are special
      windows that have no window decorations; are always visible on your
      desktop; do not appear in your pager or taskbar; and are sticky across
      all workspaces. Panel windows reserve space along a desktop edge, just
      like panels and taskbars, preventing maximized windows from
      overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on the alignment option.
      Override windows are not under the control of the window manager.
      Hints are ignored. This type of window can be useful for certain
      situations.
    default: normal
  - name: pad_percents

      Enable storing graph data explicitly by ID. This avoids resets while
      using conditional colors. This option should be disabled while using
      graphs indirectly e.g. via execpi or lua_parse. Otherwise the graph
      stays emtpy. The default value is true.
    default: true

      Parameters are either `fahrenheit` or `celsius`.

      Substitute N by a digit between 0 and 9, inclusively. The value of the
      variable is being inserted into the stuff inside conky.text at the
      corresponding position, but before some substitutions are applied:

      * `\\n` -> newline
      * `\\` -> backslash
      * `\\ ` -> space
      * `\\N` -> template argument N (starting from 1)
  - name: text_buffer_size
    desc: |-
      Size of the standard text buffer (default is 256 bytes).
      This buffer is used for intermediary text, such as individual lines,
      output from $exec vars, and various other variables. Increasing the
      size of this buffer can drastically reduce Conky's performance, but
      will allow for more text display per variable. The size of this buffer
      cannot be smaller than the default value of 256 bytes.
    args:
      - seconds
  - name: times_in_seconds
    desc: |-

      Adds spaces around certain objects to stop them from moving
      other things around. Arguments are left, right, and none (default).
      The old true/false values are deprecated and default to right/none
