  This is a listing of global configuration options for Conky. These are placed
  in the `conky.config` section of your configuration file, before `conky.text`.

  The default configuration file location is `~/.config/conky/conky.conf` or
  `${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf`. On most systems, `$sysconfdir` is `/etc`,
  and you can find the sample config file there in
  `/etc/conky/conky.conf`.

  You might want to copy the default config to `~/.config/conky/conky.conf` and
  then start modifying it. User configs can be found at
  https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Configs.

  Optional arguments are generally denoted with paretheses (i.e., `(optional)`).
values:
  - name: alignment

      Aligned position on screen, may be `none` or one of:

      |                       |                         |                        |

      |`bottom_left` (or `bl`)|`bottom_middle` (or `bm`)|`bottom_right` (or `br`)|

      In case of `panel` and `dock` [windows](#own_window_type), it might make more sense to use one
      of the following aliases:

      | Alias  |     Value     |
      |:------:|:-------------:|
      | `top`  | `top_middle`  |
      | `left` | `middle_left` |

      The paths were previously ' ' (space) separated, this functionality is
      still supported if ';' isn't found, but is deprecated and will be removed

      This function, if defined, will be called by Conky upon receiving mouse
      events from X or Wayland. A table containing event information will be

      This option will not work as desired (in most cases) in conjunction with
      ['own_window_type override'](#own_window_type).
  - name: own_window_class
    desc: Manually set the WM_CLASS name.
    default: Conky
  - name: own_window_colour
    desc: |-
      If [own_window_transparent](#own_window_transparent) no, set a specified background
      colour. Takes either a hex value (e.g. '#ffffff'),
      a shorthand hex value (e.g. '#fff'), or a valid RGB name
      (see `/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt`).
    default: black
    args:
      - color
  - name: own_window_hints
    desc: |-
      If [`own_window`](#own_window) is set, on X11 you may specify comma separated window
      manager hints to affect the way Conky displays.

      Following hints are some of the standard WM specification ones:
      - `above` indicates that conky should be on top of most windows.
      - `below` indicates that conky should be below most windows.
      - `skip_pager` indicates that conky should not be included on a
        Pager. **Implied if** [`own_window_type`](#own_window_type) is 'dock' or 'panel'.
      - `skip_taskbar` indicates that conky should not be included on a
        taskbar. **Implied if** [`own_window_type`](#own_window_type) is 'dock' or 'panel'.
      - `sticky` indicates that the Window Manager SHOULD keep conky's
        position fixed on the screen, even when the virtual desktop scrolls.
      - `undecorated` indicates that conky shouldn't have any window
        decorations (e.g. title bar). **Implied if** [`own_window_type`](#own_window_type) is
        'dock' or 'panel'.

      Notes:
      - Use `own_window_type='desktop'` setting as another way to implement many of these hints implicitly.
      - If you use `own_window_type='override'`, window manager hints have no meaning and are ignored.
    args:
      - hint(,hint)*
  - name: own_window_title
    desc: |-
      Allows overriding conky window name.
    default: 'conky (<hostname>)'
  - name: own_window_transparent
    desc: |-
      Make conky window transparent. If [`own_window_argb_visual`](#own_window_argb_visual) is enabled,
      sets background opacity to 0%.
    default: 'false'
  - name: own_window_type
    desc: |-
      If `own_window` is set, under X11 you can specify type of window conky
      displayed as:

      - `normal` mode makes conky show as normal window. This mode can be
        configured with use of [`own_window_hints`](#own_window_hints) setting.
      - `desktop` windows are special windows that have no window decorations,
        are always visible on the desktop, do not appear in pager or taskbar,
        and are sticky across all workspaces. Many DEs include `desktop` windows
        for background, icons and desktop menu, in those cases it might be
        better to use `normal` or one of the below options, as those will cover
        conky when they're clicked on.
      - `dock` windows are placed on screen edges. They're the same as `desktop`
        in most respects, but render on top of `desktop` windows and below
        `normal` ones. Conky doesn't define struts for this window type, but
        some WMs might still implicitly avoid placing windows on top of it.
      - `panel` windows are similar to `dock` windows, but they also reserve
        space _along a workarea edge_ (like taskbars), preventing maximized
        windows from overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on final conky
        position and size, and workarea dimensions, to ensure normal windows
        have most free space available. For WMs that "cut out" entirely covered
        screens from reserved area, the edge will be chosen based on `alignment`
        setting.
      - `utility` windows are persistent utility windows (e.g. a palette or
        toolbox). They appear on top of other windows (in the same group), but
        otherwise behave much like `normal` windows.
      - `override` windows are drawn directly on root window (desktop
        background) and are not under the control of the window manager. These
        will not work with DEs which draw desktop icons via custom
        panels/windows as those will cover conky.
        [`own_window_hints`](#own_window_hints) are ignored for `override` windows.

      To make conky mount on root window, set [`own_window`](#own_window) to `false`.

  - name: text_buffer_size
    desc: |-
      Size of the standard text buffer in bytes.
      This buffer is used for intermediary text, such as individual lines,
      output from $exec vars, and various other variables. Increasing the
      size of this buffer can drastically reduce Conky's performance, but
      will allow for more text display per variable. The size of this buffer
      cannot be smaller than the default value of 256 bytes.
    args:
      - integer_number
    default: 256
  - name: times_in_seconds

      represents seconds. This doesn't affect $time, $tztime and $utime.
  - name: top_cpu_separate

  - name: top_name_verbose
    desc: |-

      respectively. Note that this only helps if you are using a mono font,
      such as Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.
