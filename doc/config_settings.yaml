  This is a listing of global configuration options for Conky. These are placed
  in the `conky.config` section of your configuration file, before `conky.text`.

  The default configuration file location is `~/.config/conky/conky.conf` or
  `${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf`. On most systems, `$sysconfdir` is `/etc`,
  and you can find the sample config file there in
  `/etc/conky/conky.conf`.

  You might want to copy the default config to `~/.config/conky/conky.conf` and
  then start modifying it. User configs can be found at
  https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Configs.

  Optional arguments are generally denoted with paretheses (i.e., `(optional)`).
values:
  - name: alignment
    desc: |-
      Aligned position on screen, may be `none` or one of:

      |                       |                         |                        |

      |`middle_left` (or `ml`)|`middle_middle` (or `mm`)|`middle_right` (or `mr`)|
      |`bottom_left` (or `bl`)|`bottom_middle` (or `bm`)|`bottom_right` (or `br`)|

      In case of `panel` and `dock` windows, it might make more sense to use one
      of the following aliases:

      | Alias  |     Value     |
      |:------:|:-------------:|
      | `top`  | `top_middle`  |
      | `left` | `middle_left` |

      Specify a default height for bars.
    default: 6
  - name: default_bar_width
    desc: |-
      Specify a default width for bars. If not specified, the
      default value is 0, which causes the bar to expand to fit the width of
      your Conky window. If you set out_to_console = true, the default value
      will be 10 for the text version of the bar.

    default: 25
  - name: default_graph_width
    desc: |-
      Specify a default width for graphs. If not specified, the
      default value is 0, which causes the graph to expand to fit the width
      of your Conky window. If you set out_to_console = true, the text
      version of the graph will actually have no width and you will need to
      set a sensible default or set the height and width of each graph
      individually.

      This option will not work as desired (in most cases) in conjunction with
      'own_window_type override'.
  - name: own_window_class
    desc: Manually set the WM_CLASS name.
    default: Conky
  - name: own_window_colour
    desc: |-
      If own_window_transparent no, set a specified background
      colour. Takes either a hex value (e.g. '#ffffff'),
      a shorthand hex value (e.g. '#fff'), or a valid RGB name
      (see `/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt`).
    default: black
    args:
      - color
  - name: own_window_hints
    desc: |-
      If `own_window` is set, on X11 you may specify comma separated window
      manager hints to affect the way Conky displays.

      Following hints are some of the standard WM specification ones:
      - `above` indicates that conky should be on top of most windows.
      - `below` indicates that conky should be below most windows.
      - `skip_pager` indicates that conky should not be included on a
        Pager. **Implied if** `own_window_type` is 'dock' or 'panel'.
      - `skip_taskbar` indicates that conky should not be included on a
        taskbar. **Implied if** `own_window_type` is 'dock' or 'panel'.
      - `sticky` indicates that the Window Manager SHOULD keep conky's
        position fixed on the screen, even when the virtual desktop scrolls.
      - `undecorated` indicates that conky shouldn't have any window
        decorations (e.g. title bar). **Implied if** `own_window_type` is
        'dock' or 'panel'.

      Notes:
      - Use `own_window_type='desktop'` setting as another way to implement many of these hints implicitly.
      - If you use `own_window_type='override'`, window manager hints have no meaning and are ignored.
    args:
      - hint(,hint)*
  - name: own_window_title
    desc: |-
      Allows overriding conky window name.
    default: 'conky (<hostname>)'
  - name: own_window_transparent
    desc: |-
      Make conky window transparent. If `own_window_argb_visual` is enabled,
      sets background opacity to 0%.
    default: false
  - name: own_window_type
    desc: |-
      If `own_window` is set, under X11 you can specify type of window conky
      displayed as:

      - `normal` mode makes conky show as normal window. This mode can be
        configured with use of `own_window_hints` setting.
      - `desktop` windows are special windows that have no window decorations,
        are always visible on the desktop, do not appear in pager or taskbar,
        and are sticky across all workspaces. Many DEs include `desktop` windows
        for background, icons and desktop menu, in those cases it might be
        better to use `normal` or one of the below options, as those will cover
        conky when they're clicked on.
      - `dock` windows reserve space on the desktop, i.e. WMs will try their
        best to not place windows on top of them. They're the same as `desktop`
        in other respects, but render on top of `desktop` windows.
      - `panel` windows are similar to `dock` windows, but they also reserve
        space _along a desktop edge_ (like taskbars), preventing maximized
        windows from overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on the
        `alignment` setting.
      - `utility` windows are persistent utility windows (e.g. a palette or
        toolbox). They appear on top of other windows (in the same group), but
        otherwise behave much like `normal` windows.
      - `override` windows are drawn directly on root window (desktop
        background) and are not under the control of the window manager. These
        will not work with DEs which draw desktop icons via custom
        panels/windows as those will cover conky.
        `own_window_hints` are ignored for `override` windows.

      To make conky mount on root window, set `own_window` to `false`.
    default: normal
    args:
      - (normal|desktop|dock|panel|utility|override)
  - name: pad_percents
    desc: Pad percentages to this many decimals (0 = no padding).
  - name: pop3
    desc: |-
      Default global POP3 server. Arguments are: `host user pass
      [-i interval (in seconds)] [-p port] [-e 'command'] [-r retries]\".
      Default port is 110, default interval is 5 minutes, and default number
      of retries before giving up is 5. If the password is supplied as '*',
      you will be prompted to enter the password when Conky starts.

  - name: store_graph_data_explicitly
    desc: |-
      Enable storing graph data explicitly by ID. This avoids resets while
      using conditional colors. This option should be disabled while using
      graphs indirectly e.g. via execpi or lua_parse. Otherwise the graph
      stays emtpy. The default value is true.
    default: true
  - name: temperature_unit

      Desired output unit of all objects displaying a temperature.
      Parameters are either `fahrenheit` or `celsius`.
    default: celsius
  - name: templateN
    desc: |-
      Define a template for later use inside conky.text segments.
      Substitute N by a digit between 0 and 9, inclusively. The value of the
      variable is being inserted into the stuff inside conky.text at the
      corresponding position, but before some substitutions are applied:

      * `\\n` -> newline
      * `\\` -> backslash
      * `\\ ` -> space
      * `\\N` -> template argument N (starting from 1)
  - name: text_buffer_size
    desc: |-
      Size of the standard text buffer (default is 256 bytes).
      This buffer is used for intermediary text, such as individual lines,
      output from $exec vars, and various other variables. Increasing the
      size of this buffer can drastically reduce Conky's performance, but
      will allow for more text display per variable. The size of this buffer
      cannot be smaller than the default value of 256 bytes.
    args:
      - seconds
  - name: times_in_seconds

      power. If false, cpu in top will show the usage of all processors'
      power combined.
  - name: top_name_verbose
    desc: |-
      If true, top name shows the full command line of each
