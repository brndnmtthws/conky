1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on torsmo.  Since  its
       inception,  Conky has changed significantly from its predecessor, while
       maintaining simplicity and  configurability.  Conky  can	 display  just
       about  anything,	 either on your root desktop or in its own window. Not
       only does Conky have many built-in objects, it can  also	 display  just
       about any piece of information by using scripts and other external pro‐
       grams.

       Conky has more than 250 built  in  objects,  including  support	for  a
       plethora	 of OS stats (uname, uptime, CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage,
       "top" like process stats, and network monitoring, just to name a	 few),
       built in IMAP and POP3 support, built in support for many popular music
       players (MPD, XMMS2, BMPx, Audacious), and much much more.   Conky  can
       display	this  info  either  as text, or using simple progress bars and
       graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.

       We are always looking for help, whether	its  reporting	bugs,  writing
       patches,	 or writing docs.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge to
       make bug reports, feature requests, and	submit	patches,  or  stop  by
       #conky on irc.freenode.net if you have questions or want to contribute.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

1mCOMPILING0m
       For users compiling from source on a binary distro, make sure you  have
       the  X  development libraries installed. This should be a package along
       the lines of "libx11-dev" or "xorg-x11-dev" for X11 libs,  and  similar
       "-dev"  format for the other libs required (depending on your configure
       options).

       Conky has (for some time) been available in the	repositories  of  most
       popular	distributions.	 Here are some installation instructions for a
       few:

       Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo’s Portage... simply use "emerge app-
       admin/conky"  for  installation.	  There	 is also usually an up-to-date
       ebuild within Conky’s package or in the git repo.

       Debian, etc. users -- Conky should be in your repositories, and can  be
       installed by doing "aptitude install conky".

       Example	to  compile  and  run Conky with all optional components (note
       that some configure options may differ for your system):

       1msh autogen.sh # Only required if building from the git repo0m

       1m./configure	  --prefix=/usr	     --mandir=/usr/share/man	   --in‐0m
       1mfodir=/usr/share/info	--datadir=/usr/share  --sysconfdir=/etc --local‐0m
       1mstatedir=/var/lib --disable-own-window --enable-audacious[=yes|no|lega‐0m
       1mcy] --enable-bmpx --disable-hddtemp --disable-mpd --enable-xmms2 --dis‐0m
       1mable-portmon  --disable-network  --enable-debug  --disable-x11	  --dis‐0m
       1mable-double-buffer --disable-xdamage --disable-xft0m

       1mmake0m

       1mmake install # Optional0m

       1msrc/conky0m

       Conky has been tested to be compatible with C99 C, however it  has  not
       been tested with anything other than gcc, and is not guaranteed to work
       with other compilers.


1mYOU SHOULD KNOW0m
       Conky is generally very good on resources. That said, the more you  try
       to make Conky do, the more resources it is going to consume.

       An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1
       conky".	Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.  You
       can now also do the same with SIGHUP.

1mOPTIONS0m
       Command	line  options override configurations defined in configuration
       file.

1mCONFIGURATION SETTINGS0m
       Default	  configuration	   file	   location   is   $HOME/.conkyrc   or
       ${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf. On most systems,	 sysconfdir  is	 /etc,
       and  you can find the sample config file there (/etc/conky/conky.conf).

       You might want to copy it to $HOME/.conkyrc and	then  start  modifying
       it.  Other configs can be found at http://conky.sf.net/

       1malias	22mUse	this  to create aliases of variables. The first argument is
	      the new name, the second the old name, and the  other  arguments
	      are  passed on to the variable. Example: If you want to use $al‐
	      pha instead of ${beta gamma delta} then you have	to  write  the
	      following:  alias alpha beta gamma delta . PS: Instead of creat‐
	      ing an alias in the config you can also  use  environment	 vari‐
	      ables.  Example: Start conky like this: alpha="beta gamma delta"
	      conky


       1malignment0m

	      interface being solely up, being up and having link or being up,
	      having link and an assigned IP address.


       1mimap	22mDefault  global  IMAP server. Arguments are: "host user pass [-i
	      interval] [-f folder] [-p port] [-e command] [-r retries]".  De‐
	      fault  port  is 143, default folder is ’INBOX’, default interval
	      is 5 minutes, and default number of retries before giving up  is
	      5.  If  the password is supplied as ’*’, you will be prompted to
	      enter the password when Conky starts.

	      buffer is used for intermediary text, such as individual	lines,
	      output  from $exec vars, and various other variables. Increasing
	      the size of this buffer can drastically reduce  Conky’s  perfor‐
	      mance,  but  will	 allow for more text display per variable. The
	      size of this buffer cannot be smaller than the default value  of
	      256 bytes.

       1mown_window_hints undecorated,below,above,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager0m
	      If own_window is yes, you may use these window manager hints  to
	      affect the way Conky displays.  Notes: Use own_window_type desk‐
	      top as another way to implement many of these hints  implicitly.
	      If  you  use own_window_type override, window manager hints have
	      no meaning and are ignored.


       1mown_window_title0m
	      Manually set the window name. Defaults to "<hostname> -  conky".


       1mown_window_transparent0m

       1mown_window_type0m
	      if own_window is yes, you may specify type normal, desktop, dock
	      or override (default: normal).  Desktop windows are special win‐
	      dows that have no window decorations; are always visible on your
	      desktop; do not appear in your pager or taskbar; and are	sticky
	      across  all workspaces.  Override windows are not under the con‐
	      trol of the window manager. Hints are ignored. This type of win‐
	      dow can be useful for certain situations.

	      Print text to stdout.


       1mout_to_stderr0m
	      Print text to stderr.


       1mout_to_x0m
	      When  set	 to  no, there will be no output in X (useful when you
	      also use things like out_to_console).  If you set it to no, make
	      sure  that  it’s placed before all other X-related setting (take
	      the first line of your configfile to be sure). Default value  is
	      yes


       1moverwrite_file0m
	      Overwrite the file given as argument.


       1mappend_file0m
	      Append the file given as argument.

	      110,  default  interval  is 5 minutes, and default number of re‐
	      tries before giving up is 5. If the password is supplied as ’*’,
	      you will be prompted to enter the password when Conky starts.


       1mshort_units0m
	      Shortens units to a single character (kiB->k, GiB->G, etc.). De‐
	      fault is off.


       1mshow_graph_scale0m

	      Desired output unit of all  objects  displaying  a  temperature.
	      Parameters  are  either  "fahrenheit"  or "celsius". The default
	      unit is degree Celsius.


       1mtemplateN0m
	      Define a template for later use inside TEXT segments. Substitute
	      N	 by  a	digit  between 0 and 9, inclusively.  The value of the
	      variable is being inserted into the stuff below TEXT at the cor‐
	      responding position, but before some substitutions are applied:

	      ’\n’ -> newline
	      ’\\’ -> backslash
	      ’\ ’ -> space
	      ’\N’ -> template argument N


       1mtotal_run_times0m

       1muppercase0m
	      Boolean value, if true, text is rendered in upper case


       1muse_spacer0m
	      Adds spaces around certain objects to stop them from moving oth‐
	      er things around. Arguments are left, right, and none (default).
	      The  old	true/false  values  are	 deprecated  and  default   to
	      right/none  respectively.	 Note  that this only helps if you are
	      using a mono font, such as Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.

       1mentropy_poolsize0m
	      Total size of system entropy pool for crypto freaks


       1meval string0m
	      Evalutates given string according to the rules of TEXT interpre‐
	      tation, i.e. parsing any contained  text	object	specifications
	      into  their  output,  any occuring ’$$’ into a single ’$’ and so
	      on. The output is then being parsed again.


       1mexec command0m
	      Executes a shell command and displays the output in conky. warn‐
	      ing:  this  takes a lot more resources than other variables. I’d
	      recommend coding wanted behaviour in C and posting a patch.


       1mexecbar command0m
	      Same as exec, except if the first value return is	 a  value  be‐
	      tween 0-100, it will use that number for a bar. The size for the
	      bar is currently fixed, but that may change in the future.


       1mexecgauge command0m
	      Same as exec, except if the first value return is	 a  value  be‐
	      tween  0-100,  it will use that number for a gauge. The size for
	      the gauge is currently fixed, but you may change	that  for  the
	      future conky release.


       1mexecgraph ("normal"|"log") (height),(width) (gradient colour 1) (gradi‐0m
       1ment colour 2) (scale) command0m
	      Same as execbar, but graphs values. Uses a logaritmic scale when
	      the log option is given (to see  small  numbers).	 Values	 still
	      have to be between 0 and 100.


       1mexeci interval command0m
	      Same  as exec but with specific interval. Interval can’t be less

       1mexecp command0m
	      Executes a shell command and displays the output in conky. warn‐
	      ing:  this  takes a lot more resources than other variables. I’d
	      recommend coding wanted behaviour in C and posting a patch. This
	      differs  from $exec in that it parses the output of the command,
	      so you can insert things like ${color  red}hi!${color}  in  your
	      script  and  have	 it correctly parsed by Conky.	Caveats: Conky
	      parses and evaluates the	output	of  $execp  every  time	 Conky
	      loops, and then destroys all the objects. If you try to use any‐
	      thing like $execi within an $execp statement, it will  function‐
	      ally run at the same interval that the $execp statement runs, as
	      it is created and destroyed at every interval.


       1mexecpi interval command0m
	      Same as execp but with specific interval. Interval can’t be less
	      than update_interval in configuration. Note that the output from
	      the $execpi command is still parsed and evaluated at  every  in‐
	      terval.


       1mfont (font)0m
	      Specify  a  different font. This new font will apply to the cur‐

       1mpop3_used (args)0m
	      Displays	the amount of space (in MiB, 2^20) used in your global
	      POP3 inbox by default. You can define  individual	 POP3  inboxes
	      seperately  by  passing arguments to this object. Arguments are:
	      "host user pass [-i interval] [-p port]  [-e  command]  [-r  re‐
	      tries]". Default port is 110, default interval is 5 minutes, and
	      default number of retries before giving up is 5. If the password
	      is  supplied  as ’*’, you will be prompted to enter the password
	      when Conky starts.

       1mscroll length (step) text0m
	      Scroll  ’text’  by  ’step’ characters showing ’length’ number of
	      characters at the same time. The text  may  also	contain	 vari‐
	      ables. ’step’ is optional and defaults to 1 if not set. If a var
	      creates output on multiple lines then the lines are  placed  be‐
	      hind  each other separated with a ’|’-sign. Do NOT use vars that
	      change colors or otherwise affect the design inside a  scrolling
	      text.  If	 you  want  spaces  between  the  start and the end of
	      ’text’, place them at the end of ’text’ not at the front	("foo‐
	      bar" and " foobar" can both generate "barfoo" but "foobar " will
	      keep the spaces like this "bar foo").


       1mshadecolor (color)0m
	      Change shading color


       1msmapi (ARGS)0m
	      when using smapi, display	 contents  of  the  /sys/devices/plat‐
	      form/smapi  directory. ARGS are either ’(FILENAME)’ or ’bat (IN‐
	      DEX) (FILENAME)’ to display the  corresponding  files’  content.
	      This  is	a  very raw method of accessing the smapi values. When
	      available, better use one of the smapi_* variables instead.


       1msmapi_bat_bar (INDEX),(height),(width)0m
	      when using smapi, display the remaining capacity of the  battery
	      with index INDEX as a bar.


       1msmapi_bat_perc (INDEX)0m
	      when  using  smapi, display the remaining capacity in percent of
	      the battery with index INDEX. This is a  separate	 variable  be‐
	      cause it supports the ’use_spacer’ configuration option.


       1msmapi_bat_power INDEX0m
	      when  using smapi, display the current power of the battery with
	      index INDEX in watt. This is a  separate	variable  because  the
	      original	read out value is being converted from mW. The sign of
	      the output reflects charging (positive)  or  discharging	(nega‐
	      tive) state.


       1msmapi_bat_temp INDEX0m
	      when using smapi, display the current temperature of the battery
	      with index INDEX in degree Celsius. This is a separate  variable
	      because the original read out value is being converted from mil‐
	      li degree Celsius.

       1mtcp_portmon port_begin port_end item (index) 4m22m(ip424m 4monly24m 4mat24m 4mpresent)0m
	      TCP port monitor for specified local ports. Port numbers must be
	      in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

	      1mcount 22m- total number of connections in the range
	      1mrip 22m- remote ip address
	      1mrhost 22m- remote host name
	      1mrport 22m- remote port number
	      1mrservice 22m- remote service name from /etc/services
	      1mlip 22m- local ip address
	      1mlhost 22m- local host name
	      1mlport 22m- local port number
	      1mlservice 22m- local service name from /etc/services

	      The connection index provides you with access to each connection
	      in the port monitor. The monitor will return information for in‐
	      dex values from 0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are
	      simply ignored. For the "count" item, the connection index  must
	      be omitted. It is required for all other items.

	      Examples:
	      1m${tcp_portmon  6881 6999 count} 22m- displays the number of connec‐
	      tions in the bittorrent port range
	      1m${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0} 22m- displays the remote host ip of	the
	      first sshd connection
	      1m${tcp_portmon  22 22 rip 9} 22m- displays the remote host ip of the
	      tenth sshd connection
	      1m${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0} 22m- displays the remote host name of
	      the first connection on a privileged port
	      1m${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4} 22m- displays the remote host port of
	      the fifth connection on a privileged port
	      1m${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14} 22m- displays the local  service
	      name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports

	      Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range
	      actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a sin‐
	      gle port range for different items and different indexes all use
	      the same monitor internally. In other words, the program	avoids
	      creating redundant monitors.

       1mtexeci interval command0m
	      Runs  a  command at an interval inside a thread and displays the
	      output. Same as $execi, except  the  command  is	run  inside  a
	      thread.  Use this if you have a slow script to keep Conky updat‐
	      ing. You should make the interval slightly longer then the  time
	      it  takes	 your  script  to  execute. For example, if you have a
	      script that take 5 seconds to execute, you should make  the  in‐
	      terval at least 6 seconds. See also $execi.


       1moffset (pixels)0m
	      Move text over by N pixels. See also $voffset.


       1mrss url delay_in_minutes action item_num0m
	      Download	and  parse RSS feeds. Action may be one of the follow‐
	      ing: feed_title, item_title (with num par), item_desc (with  num
	      par) and item_titles.


       1mtab (width, (start))0m
	      Puts a tab of the specified width, starting from column ’start’.


       1mtail logfile lines (interval)0m
	      Displays last N lines of supplied text text file. If interval is
	      not supplied, Conky assumes 2x Conky’s interval. Max of 30 lines
	      can be displayed, or until the text buffer is filled.


       1mtemplateN (arg1) (arg2) (arg3 ...)0m
	      Evaluate the content of  the  templateN  configuration  variable
	      (where N is a value between 0 and 9, inclusively), applying sub‐
	      stitutions as described in the documentation of the  correspond‐
	      ing  configuration variable.  The number of arguments is option‐
	      al, but must match the highest referred index in	the  template.
	      You  can	use the same special sequences in each argument as the
	      ones valid for a template definition, e.g. to allow an  argument
	      to  contain  a  whitespace.  Also simple nesting of templates is
	      possible this way.

	      Here are some examples of template definitions:

	      template0 $\1\2
	      template1 \1: ${fs_used \2} / ${fs_size \2}
	      template2 \1 \2

	      The following list shows sample usage of the  templates  defined
	      above, with the equivalent syntax when not using any template at
	      all:

	      using template				same without template
	      ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	      ${template0 node name}			$nodename
	      ${template1 root /}			root:	${fs_free   /}	 /
							${fs_size /}
	      ${template1 ${template2\ disk\ root} /}	disk root: ${fs_free /} / ${fs_size /}

       1mtop type, num0m
	      This  takes arguments in the form:top (name) (number) Basically,
	      processes are ranked from highest to lowest in terms of cpu  us‐
	      age,  which  is  what  (num)  represents. The types are: "name",

1mBUGS0m
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn’t work with
       all window managers. Especially doesn’t work well with Gnome and it has
       been  reported  that  it	 doesn’t work with KDE either. Nautilus can be
       disabled from drawing to desktop	 with  program	gconf-editor.  Uncheck
       show_desktop  in	 /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is  -w switch in
       Conky to set some specific window id. You  might	 find  xwininfo	 -tree
       useful  to  find	 the  window  to draw to. You can also use -o argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window. If you do try running Conky
       in  its	own window, be sure to read up on the own_window_type settings
       and experiment.
