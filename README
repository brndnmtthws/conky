NAME
       conky - a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but
       more kickass.

SYNOPSIS
       conky [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on  the	 torsmo	 code.
       Since  it's original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from it's
       predecessor.  Conky can display just about  anything,  either  on  your
       root  desktop  or in it's own window.  Conky has many built-in objects,
       as well as the ability to execute programs and  scripts,	 then  display
       the output from stdout.

       We  are	always	looking	 for help, and anyone interested in becoming a
       developer is welcome.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge to make
       bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

COMPILING
       First,  make  sure you have the X development libraries installed, this
       should be a package along the lines of  "libx11-dev  or	xorg-x11-dev".
       Gentoo  users,  Conky is in Gentoo's Portage. Simply use "emerge conky"
       for installation.  There is also usually an  up-to-date	ebuild	within
       Conky's package or in CVS.

       To compile and run Conky with all optional components:

       sh autogen.sh # Only required if building from CVS

       ./configure	      --prefix=/usr	       --mandir=/usr/share/man
       --infodir=/usr/share/info   --datadir=/usr/   share   --sysconfdir=/etc
       --localstatedir=/var/lib	  --enable-double-buffer   --enable-own-window
       --enable-proc-uptime --enable-mpd --enable-xft --enable-seti

       make

       make install # Optional

       ./conky

       Conky  doesn't  probably compile with other compilers than gcc and icc.
       It doesn't compile with C89 compiler and not even with  pure  C99.   It
       uses  few  things  that	might not exist: strdup(), strcasecmp(), strn-
       casecmp(), optarg variable with getopt() and long long  (not  in	 C89).
       Crashes in file system statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I don't
       know exactly why.

       You can disable 'drawing to own window' feature in case you don't  need
       it by passing --disable-own-window to configure -script.


YOU SHOULD KNOW
       Conky  is generally very good on resources. However, certain objects in
       Conky are harder on resources then others. In  particular,  the	$tail,
       $top,  $font,  and $graph objects are quite costly in comparison to the
       rest of Conky.

       If you do use them, please do not complain about memory or  CPU	usage,
       unless  you  think  something  is  going	 seriously wrong (mem leak, et
       cetera).

OPTIONS
       Command line options override configurations defined  in	 configuration
       file.

       -V     Prints version and exits


       -a ALIGNMENT
	      Text alignment on screen, {top,bottom}_{left,right} or none


       -b     Use double buffering (eliminates "flicker")


       -c FILE
	      Config file to load instead of $HOME/.conkyrc


       -d     Daemonize Conky, aka fork to background


       -f FONT
	      Font to use


       -h     Prints command line help and exits


       -o     Create own window to draw


       -t TEXT
	      Text to render, remember single quotes, like -t ' $uptime '


       -u SECONDS
	      Update interval


       -w WIN_ID
	      Window id to draw


       -x X_COORDINATE
	      X position


       -y Y_COORDINATE
	      Y position


CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
       Default	configuration  file  is	 $HOME/.conkyrc	 (can  be changed from
       conky.c among other things). See conkyrc.sample. You might want to copy
       it to $HOME/.conkyrc and then start modifying it.

       alignment
	      Aligned  position	 on  screen,  may be top_left, top_right, bot-
	      tom_left, bottom_right, or none


       background

EXAMPLES
       conky -t '${time %D %H:%m}' -o -u 30
	      Start Conky in its own window with date and clock as text and 30
	      sec update interval.

	      Start Conky to background at coordinates (5, 500).

FILES
       ~/.conkyrc default configuration file

BUGS
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with
       all window managers. Especially doesn't work well with Gnome and it has
       been  reported  that  it	 doesn't work with KDE either. Nautilus can be
       disabled from drawing to desktop	 with  program	gconf-editor.  Uncheck
       show_desktop  in	 /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is  -w switch in
       Conky to set some specific window id. You  might	 find  xwininfo	 -tree
       useful  to  find	 the  window  to draw to. You can also use -o argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window.
