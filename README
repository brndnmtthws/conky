NAME
       conky - A system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but
       more kickass. It just keeps on given'er. Yeah.

SYNOPSIS
       conky [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on  the	 torsmo	 code.
       Since  it's original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from it's
       predecessor.  Conky can display just about  anything,  either  on  your
       root  desktop  or in it's own window.  Conky has many built-in objects,
       as well as the ability to execute programs and  scripts,	 then  display
       the output from stdout.

       We are always looking for help, and anyone interested in becoming a de-
       veloper is welcome.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge  to  make
       bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

COMPILING
       For  users  compiling from source, make sure you have the X development
       libraries installed.  This should be  a	package	 along	the  lines  of
       "libx11-dev or xorg-x11-dev".

       Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app-
       admin/conky" for installation.  There is	 also  usually	an  up-to-date
       ebuild within Conky's package or in Svn.

       Debian,etc.  users  --  Conky will be in Debian's repositories soon (by
       mid-September, hopefully), and then Ubuntu  shortly  thereafter.	 Until
       then, "dpkg -i" the .deb package to install.

       Example	to  compile  and  run Conky with all optional components (note
       that some configure options may differ for your system):

       sh autogen.sh # Only required if building from Svn

       ./configure	--prefix=/usr	   --mandir=/usr/share/man	 --in-
       fodir=/usr/share/info  --datadir=/usr/share  --sysconfdir=/etc --local-
       statedir=/var/lib --enable-xft --enable-own-window --enable-proc-uptime
       --enable-audacious  --enable-infopipe --enable-bmpx --enable-seti --en-
       able-hddtemp --enable-mpd --enable-xmms2 --enable-imlib2 --enable-port-
       mon   --enable-mldonkey	 --enable-debug	 --enable-double-buffer	 --en-
       able-xdamage --enable-x11

       make

       make install # Optional

       src/conky

       Conky probably doesn't compile with compilers other than gcc  and  icc.
       It  doesn't  compile  with C89 compiler and not even with pure C99.  It
       uses a few things that might not exist: strdup(),  strcasecmp(),	 strn-
       casecmp(),  optarg  variable  with getopt() and long long (not in C89).
       Crashes in file system statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I don't
       know exactly why.

       You  can disable 'drawing to own window' feature in case you don't need
       it by passing --disable-own-window to configure -script.


YOU SHOULD KNOW
       Conky is generally very good on resources. However, certain objects  in
       Conky  are  harder  on resources then others. In particular, the $tail,
       $top, $font, and $graph objects are quite costly in comparison  to  the
       rest of Conky.

       If  you	do use them, please do not complain about memory or CPU usage,
       unless you think something's seriously wrong (mem leak, etc.).

       An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1
       conky".	Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.

       IMPORTANT:  For	previous Conky users, Conky 1.3 no longer supports the
       metar stuff.  mdsplib was causing  way  too  many  problems.  Hopefully
       there'll be a better solution in Conky 2.x...

OPTIONS

       -a ALIGNMENT
	      Text alignment on screen, {top,bottom}_{left,right} or none


       -b     Use double buffering (eliminates "flicker")


       -c FILE
	      Config file to load instead of $HOME/.conkyrc


       -d     Daemonize Conky, aka fork to background


       -f FONT
	      Font to use


       -h     Prints command line help and exits


       -o     Create own window to draw


       -t TEXT
	      Text to render, remember single quotes, like -t ' $uptime '

	      Y position


CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
       Default configuration file  is  $HOME/.conkyrc  (can  be	 changed  from
       conky.c among other things). See conkyrc.sample. If installing from De-
       bian package, this should be in /usr/share/doc/conky/examples  ("gunzip
       conkyrc.sample.gz" to get conkyrc.sample).

       You  might  want	 to copy it to $HOME/.conkyrc and then start modifying
       it.  Other configs can be found at http://conky.sf.net

       alignment

	      Boolean, set pseudo-transparency?


       own_window_type
	      if own_window is yes, you may specify type  normal,  desktop  or

	      that have no window decorations;	are  always  visible  on  your
	      desktop;	do not appear in your pager or taskbar; and are sticky
	      across all workspaces.  Override windows are not under the  con-
	      trol of the window manager. Hints are ignored. This type of win-
	      dow can be useful for certain situations.


       own_window_colour colour
	      If own_window_transparent no, set a specified background	colour
	      (defaults	 to  black).  Takes  either a hex value (#ffffff) or a

       own_window_hints undecorated,below,above,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager
	      If own_window is yes, you may use these window manager hints  to
	      affect the way Conky displays.  Notes: Use own_window_type desk-
	      top as another way to implement many of these hints  implicitly.
	      If  you  use own_window_type override, window manager hints have
	      no meaning and are ignored.


       out_to_console
	      Print text to stdout.


       pad_percents
	      Pad percentages to this many decimals (0 = no padding)


       pop3   Default global POP3 server. Arguments are: "host user  pass  [-i
	      interval]	 [-p port] [-e command]". Default port is 110, default
	      interval is 5 minutes. If the password is supplied as  '*',  you
	      will be prompted to enter the password when Conky starts.


       stippled_borders
	      Border stippling (dashing) in pixels


       total_run_times
	      Total  number of times for Conky to update before quitting. Zero
	      makes Conky run forever

	      things around. Note that this only helps if you are using a mono
	      font, such as Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.


       use_xft
	      Use Xft (anti-aliased font and stuff)


       wm_class_name
	      Manually set the WM_CLASS name. Defaults to "conky".


       xftalpha
	      Alpha of Xft font. Must be a value at or between 1 and 0.


       xftfont
	      Xft font to use.


       TEXT   After this begins text to be formatted on screen


VARIABLES
       Colors are parsed using XParsecolor(), there might be a list  of	 them:
       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt.  Also, <http://sedition.com/perl/rgb.html>.
       Color can be also in #rrggbb format (hex).  Note that  when  displaying
       bytes,  power  is  1024 and not 1000 so 1M really means 1024*1024 bytes

       tcp_portmon port_begin port_end item (index) (ip4 only at present)
	      TCP port monitor for specified local ports. Port numbers must be
	      in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

	      count - total number of connections in the range
	      rip - remote ip address
	      rhost - remote host name
	      rport - remote port number
	      rservice - remote service name from /etc/services
	      lip - local ip address
	      lhost - local host name
	      lport - local port number
	      lservice - local service name from /etc/services

	      The connection index provides you with access to each connection
	      in the port monitor. The monitor will return information for in-
	      dex values from 0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are
	      simply ignored. For the "count" item, the connection index  must
	      be omitted. It is required for all other items.

	      Examples:
	      ${tcp_portmon  6881 6999 count} - displays the number of connec-
	      tions in the bittorrent port range
	      ${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0} - displays the remote host ip of  the
	      first sshd connection
	      ${tcp_portmon  22 22 rip 9} - displays the remote host ip of the
	      tenth sshd connection
	      ${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0} - displays the remote host name of
	      the first connection on a privileged port
	      ${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4} - displays the remote host port of
	      the fifth connection on a privileged port
	      ${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14} - displays the local  service
	      name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports

	      Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range
	      actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a sin-
	      gle port range for different items and different indexes all use
	      the same monitor internally. In other words, the program	avoids
	      creating redundant monitors.

       texeci interval command
	      Runs  a  command at an interval inside a thread and displays the
	      output. Same as $execi, except  the  command  is	run  inside  a
	      thread.  Use this if you have a slow script to keep Conky updat-
	      ing. You should make the interval slightly longer then the  time
	      it  takes	 your  script  to  execute. For example, if you have a
	      script that take 5 seconds to execute, you should make  the  in-
	      terval at least 6 seconds. See also $execi.


       offset (pixels)
	      Move text over by N pixels. See also $voffset.


       tab (width, (start))
	      Puts a tab of the specified width, starting from column 'start'.


       tail logfile lines (interval)
	      Displays last N lines of supplied text text file. If interval is
	      not supplied, Conky assumes 2x Conky's interval. Max of 30 lines
	      can be displayed, or until the text buffer is filled.


       time (format)
	      Local time, see man strftime to get more information about  for-
	      mat


       utime (format)
	      Display time in UTC (universal coordinate time).


       tztime (timezone) (format)
	      Local  time for specified timezone, see man strftime to get more
	      information about format. The timezone argument is specified  in
	      similar  fashion	as TZ environment variable. For hints, look in
	      /usr/share/zoneinfo. e.g. US/Pacific, Europe/Zurich, etc.


       totaldown net
	      Total download, overflows at 4 GB on Linux with 32-bit arch  and
	      there doesn't seem to be a way to know how many times it has al-
	      ready done that before conky has started.


       top type, num
	      This takes arguments in the form:top (name) (number)  Basically,
	      processes	 are ranked from highest to lowest in terms of cpu us-
	      age, which is what (num)	represents.  The  types	 are:  "name",
	      "pid",  "cpu",  and  "mem".  There  can be a max of 10 processes
	      listed.


       top_mem type, num
	      Same as top, except sorted by mem usage instead of cpu


       totalup net
	      Total upload, this one too, may overflow


       updates Number of updates
	      for debugging


       upspeed net
	      Upload speed in kilobytes


       upspeedf net
	      Upload speed in kilobytes with one decimal


       upspeedgraph net (height),(width) (gradient colour 1) (gradient	colour
       2) (scale)
	      Upload speed graph, colours defined in  hex,  minus  the	#.  If
	      scale is non-zero, it becomes the scale for the graph.


       uptime Uptime


       uptime_short
	      Uptime in a shorter format


       seti_prog
	      Seti@home current progress


       seti_progbar (height),(width)
	      Seti@home current progress bar


       seti_credit
	      Seti@home total user credit


       voffset (pixels)
	      Change  vertical	offset by N pixels. Negative values will cause
	      text to overlap. See also $offset.


       voltage_mv (n)
	      Returns CPU #n's voltage in mV. CPUs  are	 counted  from	1.  If
	      omitted, the parameter defaults to 1.


       voltage_v (n)
	      Returns CPU #n's voltage in V. CPUs are counted from 1. If omit-
	      ted, the parameter defaults to 1.


EXAMPLES
       conky -t '${time %D %H:%m}' -o -u 30
	      Start Conky in its own window with date and clock as text and 30
	      sec update interval.

       conky -a top_left -x 5 -y 500 -d
	      Start Conky to background at coordinates (5, 500).

FILES
       ~/.conkyrc default configuration file

BUGS
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with
       all window managers. Especially doesn't work well with Gnome and it has
       been  reported  that  it	 doesn't work with KDE either. Nautilus can be
       disabled from drawing to desktop	 with  program	gconf-editor.  Uncheck
       show_desktop  in	 /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is  -w switch in
       Conky to set some specific window id. You  might	 find  xwininfo	 -tree
       useful  to  find	 the  window  to draw to. You can also use -o argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window.
