NAME
       conky - A system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but
       more kickass. It just keeps on given'er. Yeah.

SYNOPSIS
       conky [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on torsmo.  Since  its
       inception,  Conky has changed significantly from its predecessor, while
       maintaining simplicity and  configurability.  Conky  can	 display  just
       about  anything,	 either on your root desktop or in its own window. Not
       only does Conky have many built-in objects, it can  also	 display  just
       about any piece of information by using scripts and other external pro-
       grams.

       Conky has more than 250 built  in  objects,  including  support	for  a
       plethora	 of OS stats (uname, uptime, CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage,
       "top" like process stats, and network monitoring, just to name a	 few),
       built in IMAP and POP3 support, built in support for many popular music
       players (MPD, XMMS2, BMPx, Audacious), and much much more.   Conky  can
       display	this  info  either  as text, or using simple progress bars and
       graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.

       We are always looking for help, whether	its  reporting	bugs,  writing
       patches,	 or writing docs.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge to
       make bug reports, feature requests, and	submit	patches,  or  stop  by
       #conky on irc.freenode.net if you have questions or want to contribute.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

COMPILING
       For users compiling from source on a binary distro, make sure you  have
       the  X  development libraries installed. This should be a package along
       the lines of "libx11-dev" or "xorg-x11-dev" for X11 libs,  and  similar
       "-dev"  format for the other libs required (depending on your configure
       options).

       Conky has (for some time) been available in the	repositories  of  most
       popular	distributions.	 Here are some installation instructions for a
       few:

       Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app-
       admin/conky"  for  installation.	  There	 is also usually an up-to-date
       ebuild within Conky's package or in SVN.

       Debian, etc. users -- Conky should be in your repositories, and can  be
       installed by doing "aptitude install conky".

       Example	to  compile  and  run Conky with all optional components (note
       that some configure options may differ for your system):

       sh autogen.sh # Only required if building from SVN

       ./configure	--prefix=/usr	   --mandir=/usr/share/man	 --in-
       fodir=/usr/share/info  --datadir=/usr/share  --sysconfdir=/etc --local-
       statedir=/var/lib --disable-own-window --enable-audacious[=yes|no|lega-
       cy] --enable-bmpx --disable-hddtemp --disable-mpd --enable-xmms2 --dis-
       able-portmon  --disable-network	--enable-debug	--disable-x11	--dis-
       able-double-buffer --disable-xdamage --disable-xft

       make

       make install # Optional

       src/conky

       Conky has been tested to be compatible with C99 C, however it  has  not
       been tested with anything other than gcc, and is not guaranteed to work
       with other compilers.


YOU SHOULD KNOW
       Conky is generally very good on resources. That said, the more you  try
       to make Conky do, the more resources it is going to consume.

       An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1
       conky".	Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.  You
       can now also do the same with SIGHUP.

OPTIONS
       Command	line  options override configurations defined in configuration
       file.

CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
       Default	  configuration	   file	   location   is   $HOME/.conkyrc   or
       ${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf. On most systems,	 sysconfdir  is	 /etc,
       and  you can find the sample config file there (/etc/conky/conky.conf).

       You might want to copy it to $HOME/.conkyrc and	then  start  modifying
       it.  Other configs can be found at http://conky.sf.net/

       alignment
	      Aligned position on screen, may be top_left, top_right, top_mid-
	      dle, bottom_left, bottom_right, bottom_middle, middle_left, mid-
	      dle_right,  or  none  (also can be abreviated as tl, tr, tm, bl,
	      br, bm, ml, mr)

       default_shade_color
	      Default shading color and border's shading color


       double_buffer
	      Use the Xdbe extension? (eliminates flicker) It is highly recom-
	      mended to use own window with this one so double buffer won't be

	      passing -y at command line, e.g. gap_y 10.


       if_up_strictness
	      How  strict  should if_up be when testing an interface for being
	      up? The value is one of up, link or address, to  check  for  the
	      interface being solely up, being up and having link or being up,
	      having link and an assigned IP address.


       imap   Default global IMAP server. Arguments are: "host user  pass  [-i
	      interval]	 [-f  folder] [-p port] [-e command]". Default port is
	      143, default folder is 'INBOX', default interval is  5  minutes.

	      buffer is used for intermediary text, such as individual	lines,
	      output  from $exec vars, and various other variables. Increasing
	      the size of this buffer can drastically reduce  Conky's  perfor-
	      mance,  but  will	 allow for more text display per variable. The
	      size of this buffer cannot be smaller than the default value  of
	      256 bytes.

	      valid RGB name (see /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt)


       own_window_hints undecorated,below,above,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager
	      If own_window is yes, you may use these window manager hints  to
	      affect the way Conky displays.  Notes: Use own_window_type desk-
	      top as another way to implement many of these hints  implicitly.
	      If  you  use own_window_type override, window manager hints have
	      no meaning and are ignored.

	      dows that have no window decorations; are always visible on your
	      desktop; do not appear in your pager or taskbar; and are	sticky
	      across  all workspaces.  Override windows are not under the con-
	      trol of the window manager. Hints are ignored. This type of win-
	      dow can be useful for certain situations.

	      will be prompted to enter the password when Conky starts.


       short_units
	      Shortens units to a single character (kiB->k, GiB->G, etc.). De-
	      fault is off.

       exec command
	      Executes a shell command and displays the output in conky. warn-
	      ing:  this  takes a lot more resources than other variables. I'd
	      recommend coding wanted behaviour in C and posting a patch.


       execbar command
	      Same as exec, except if the first value return is	 a  value  be-
	      tween 0-100, it will use that number for a bar. The size for the
	      bar is currently fixed, but that may change in the future.


       execgraph command
	      Same as execbar, but graphs values.


       execi interval command
	      Same as exec but with specific interval. Interval can't be  less
	      than update_interval in configuration. See also $texeci


       execibar interval command
	      Same as execbar, except with an interval


       execigraph interval command
	      Same as execgraph, but takes an interval arg graphs values


       execp command
	      Executes a shell command and displays the output in conky. warn-
	      ing: this takes a lot more resources than other  variables.  I'd
	      recommend coding wanted behaviour in C and posting a patch. This
	      differs from $exec in that it parses the output of the  command,
	      so  you  can  insert things like ${color red}hi!${color} in your
	      script and have it correctly parsed by  Conky.   Caveats:	 Conky
	      parses  and  evaluates  the  output  of  $execp every time Conky
	      loops, and then destroys all the objects. If you try to use any-
	      thing  like $execi within an $execp statement, it will function-
	      ally run at the same interval that the $execp statement runs, as
	      it is created and destroyed at every interval.


       execpi interval command
	      Same as execp but with specific interval. Interval can't be less
	      than update_interval in configuration. Note that the output from
	      the  $execpi  command is still parsed and evaluated at every in-
	      terval.


       font (font)
	      Specify a different font. This new font will apply to  the  cur-
	      rent  line and everything following. You can use a $font with no
	      arguments to change back to the default  font  (much  like  with
	      $color)

       tcp_portmon port_begin port_end item (index) (ip4 only at present)
	      TCP port monitor for specified local ports. Port numbers must be
	      in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

	      count - total number of connections in the range
	      rip - remote ip address
	      rhost - remote host name
	      rport - remote port number
	      rservice - remote service name from /etc/services
	      lip - local ip address
	      lhost - local host name
	      lport - local port number
	      lservice - local service name from /etc/services

	      The connection index provides you with access to each connection
	      in the port monitor. The monitor will return information for in-
	      dex values from 0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are
	      simply ignored. For the "count" item, the connection index  must
	      be omitted. It is required for all other items.

	      Examples:
	      ${tcp_portmon  6881 6999 count} - displays the number of connec-
	      tions in the bittorrent port range
	      ${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0} - displays the remote host ip of  the
	      first sshd connection
	      ${tcp_portmon  22 22 rip 9} - displays the remote host ip of the
	      tenth sshd connection
	      ${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0} - displays the remote host name of
	      the first connection on a privileged port
	      ${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4} - displays the remote host port of
	      the fifth connection on a privileged port
	      ${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14} - displays the local  service
	      name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports

	      Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range
	      actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a sin-
	      gle port range for different items and different indexes all use
	      the same monitor internally. In other words, the program	avoids
	      creating redundant monitors.

       texeci interval command
	      Runs  a  command at an interval inside a thread and displays the
	      output. Same as $execi, except  the  command  is	run  inside  a
	      thread.  Use this if you have a slow script to keep Conky updat-
	      ing. You should make the interval slightly longer then the  time
	      it  takes	 your  script  to  execute. For example, if you have a
	      script that take 5 seconds to execute, you should make  the  in-
	      terval at least 6 seconds. See also $execi.

BUGS
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with
       all window managers. Especially doesn't work well with Gnome and it has
       been reported that it doesn't work with KDE  either.  Nautilus  can  be
       disabled	 from  drawing	to  desktop with program gconf-editor. Uncheck
       show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is	-w  switch  in
       Conky  to  set  some  specific window id. You might find xwininfo -tree
       useful to find the window to draw to. You  can  also  use  -o  argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window. If you do try running Conky
       in its own window, be sure to read up on the  own_window_type  settings
       and experiment.
