		and the dxt-sysinfo plugin (svn only at the moment).
	* new config items:
		- dexter_client yes/no
		- dexter_server yes/no
		- dexter_config /path/to/libdexter/config (default: $HOME/.dexterrc)
		- own_window_class <WM Class Name> (default: Conky)
			- replaces wm_class_name
		- own_window_title <Window Title> (default: <hostname> - conky)

		- do not pass button clicks through to desktop in this scenario as conky
		  immediately loses focus.
