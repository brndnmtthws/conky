**Conky** is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays
any kind of information on your desktop. It can also run on Wayland (with caveats), macOS, output
to your console, a file, or even HTTP (oh my!).

## Features

Conky can display more than 300 built-in objects, including support for:

- A plethora of OS stats (uname, uptime, **CPU usage**, **mem
  usage**, disk usage, **"top"** like process stats, and **network
  monitoring**, just to name a few).
- Built-in **IMAP** and **POP3** support.
- Built-in support for many popular music players ([MPD][],
  [XMMS2][], [Audacious][]).
- Can be extended using built-in [**Lua**][luawiki] support, or any of your
  own scripts and programs ([more](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki#tutorial)).
- Built-in [**Imlib2**][imlib2] and [**Cairo**][cairo] bindings for arbitrary drawing
  with Lua ([more](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Lua)).
- Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Haiku, and macOS!
- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/brndnmtthws/conky/) available for amd64, armv7, and aarch64 (aka armv8)

... and much much more.

Conky can display information either as text, or using simple progress bars and
graph widgets, with different fonts and colours, as well as handle [mouse events](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Mouse-Events).

## Installing Conky

Many package managers already include Conky. However, if you'd like to try the
latest version of Conky, you can use the AppImage or the Nix flake.

### AppImage

To try the AppImage, head to
<https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/releases/latest> and fetch the latest
AppImage. You'll need to set the executable bit, then you can create a conkyrc,
and run it as follows:

```ShellSession
chmod +x ./conky-*.AppImage        # make it executable
./conky-*.AppImage -C > ~/.conkyrc # create a default config
./conky-*.AppImage                 # run
```

And that's it! [Check out the Wiki](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki) for more details on configuring Conky.

_NOTE_: To use the AppImage, you may need to install additional runtime libraries.

### Nix flake

As of Conky v1.17.0, there's a Nix flake available in addition to the upstream
Nix package. You can include it as an input as follows:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    conky.url = "github:brndnmtthws/conky";
  };
}
```

And use `inputs.conky.packages.${system}.default` (or
`inputs.conky.packages.${system}.conky` for versions <=v1.19.8) to include the
package. To use a specific version, add the git tag to the URL, such as
`github:brndnmtthws/conky?ref=refs/tags/v1.19.8`.

Note that a Nix package [exists in
nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-unstable/pkgs/os-specific/linux/conky/default.nix), and
although it's not always up-to-date with the bleeding edge, it does offer more configuration options.
