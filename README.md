[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brndnmtthws/conky.png)](https://travis-ci.org/brndnmtthws/conky)

**Conky** is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays
any kind of information on your desktop.

- Stable version: [**1.9.0**][stable-src]
- Development version: [**master**][devel-src]


### Features

Conky can display more than 300 built-in objects, including support for:

 * A plethora of OS stats (uname, uptime, **CPU usage**, **mem
   usage**, disk usage, **"top"** like process stats, and **network
   monitoring**, just to name a few).
 * Built-in **IMAP** and **POP3** support.
 * Built-in support for many popular music players ([MPD][],
   [XMMS2][], [BMPx][], [Audacious][]).
 * Can be extended using built-in [**Lua**](lua) support, or any of your
   own scripts and programs ([more](Lua Interface)).
 * Built-in [**Imlib2**][Imlib2] and [**Cairo**][cairo] bindings for arbitrary drawing
   with Lua ([more](wiki/Lua-Interface)).

... and much much more.

Conky can display information either as text, or using simple progress
bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.
