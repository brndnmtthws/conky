## Conky for macOS

**Conky** is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays
any kind of information on your desktop.

**AND** this is an attempt to bringing **Conky** on macOS! ***PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MAY NOT BE DOABLE*** or may require complete redesign of some parts of conky... For original project checkout this: [Original Project](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky)

BUT THESE ARE THE FEATURES THE REAL CONKY SUPPORTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON MACOS, TOO:

Conky can display more than 300 built-in objects, including support for:

 * A plethora of OS stats (uname, uptime, **CPU usage**, **mem
   usage**, disk usage, **"top"** like process stats, and **network
   monitoring**, just to name a few).
 * Built-in **IMAP** and **POP3** support.
 * Built-in support for many popular music players ([MPD][],
   [XMMS2][], [BMPx][], [Audacious][]).
 * Can be extended using built-in [**Lua**](lua) support, or any of your
   own scripts and programs ([more](Lua Interface)).
 * Built-in [**Imlib2**][Imlib2] and [**Cairo**][cairo] bindings for arbitrary drawing
   with Lua ([more](wiki/Lua-API)).

... and much much more.

Conky can display information either as text, or using simple progress
bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.

### Build on macOS

#### What you need

* Xcode command-line tools
* Homebrew
* Xquartz

Once you get these installed please run the following commands as you see them!
**The last command MUST be run if you want gettext support!**

```
brew install cmake freetype gettext lua
brew link --force gettext
```

#### Actual build process

download/clone project, then cd into project's directory, 
and... Choose if you want to use Unix Makefiles or Xcode build system.

**If you want to use Unix Makefiles then type the**

```
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
```

Here you will have to press 'c', then when the configuring finishes, type 'e'.
You will see a list with all availiable build options.  Go down and enable BUILD_ICONV.

Then press 'c' again, when it finishes 'e', then 'c' again, 'e' and finally 'g'...
Thats it...

Type:

```
make
make install ( if you want to install it )
```

If you hit make install just type 'conky' on terminal to run it, otherwise just go into the build directory you made and find
the conky executable

**USE XCODE FOR BUILDING / DEVELOPING**

It is possible to use Xcode to build the project...

download/clone project, then cd into project's directory, 
and... 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Xcode
```

this should make an xcode project inside the build directory you just created.
Head into it and find the conky.xcodeproj file and open it...

This should launch Xcode! Once that is ready, you should see your project called "conky" on the left.
Select that and basically look at the project options in the middle of your screen where it says: "Resource Tags", "Build Settings" etc.  Also, on top of "Prefetched" it says "ALL_BUILD".  Click that and select "conky" instead.  Select "Build Settings" !!

```
Under Search Paths->Library Search Paths-> add /usr/local/lib
Under Search Paths->Header Search Paths-> add /usr/local/include
```
You now need to make sure your build target is "BUILD_ALL".  To do this just click the button next to the one saying "My Mac" on the upper-left and then choose "BUILD_ALL" from the options shown. ( this is important because it builds some files for conky to compile. )

Then hit build.  Once it has finished, change the build target to "conky" and hit "run"... Thats it! You can now work on conky using Xcode!

You can now hit build to build all targets but this will not run conky.  Select on the upper left corner the target to be conky and build/run again..

**These Xcode configuration steps probably wont be needed in future versions!**
