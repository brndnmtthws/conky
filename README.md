### Features

Conky can display more than 300 built-in objects, including support for:

 * A plethora of OS stats (uname, uptime, **CPU usage**, **mem
   usage**, disk usage, **"top"** like process stats, and **network
   monitoring**, just to name a few).
 * Built-in **IMAP** and **POP3** support.
 * Built-in support for many popular music players ([MPD][],
   [XMMS2][], [BMPx][], [Audacious][]).
 * Can be extended using built-in [**Lua**](lua) support, or any of your
   own scripts and programs ([more](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki#tutorial)).
 * Built-in [**Imlib2**][Imlib2] and [**Cairo**][cairo] bindings for arbitrary drawing
   with Lua ([more](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Lua-API)).
 * Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Haiku OS, and macOS!

... and much much more.

Conky can display information either as text, or using simple progress
bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.
