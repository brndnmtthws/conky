**Conky** is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays
any kind of information on your desktop. It can also run on Wayland, macOS, output
to your console, a file, or even HTTP (oh my!).

## Features

Conky can display more than 300 built-in objects, including support for:

- A plethora of OS stats (uname, uptime, **CPU usage**, **mem
  usage**, disk usage, **"top"** like process stats, and **network
  monitoring**, just to name a few).
- Built-in **IMAP** and **POP3** support.
- Built-in support for many popular music players ([MPD][],
  [XMMS2][], [Audacious][]).
- Can be extended using built-in [**Lua**](lua) support, or any of your
  own scripts and programs ([more](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki#tutorial)).
- Built-in [**Imlib2**][imlib2] and [**Cairo**][cairo] bindings for arbitrary drawing
  with Lua ([more](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Lua)).
- Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Haiku, and macOS!
- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/brndnmtthws/conky/) available for amd64, armv7, and aarch64 (aka armv8)

... and much much more.

Conky can display information either as text, or using simple progress
bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.

## Quickstart

Conky comes bundled with many package managers. However, if you'd like to try the latest release of Conky, you can try the AppImage build. If you have `jq` and `curl` installed, run the following command to fetch the latest AppImage:

```ShellSession
$ curl -sL -o conky-x86_64.AppImage \
    $(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/brndnmtthws/conky/releases/latest | \
    jq --raw-output '.assets[0] | .browser_download_url')
$ ls
conky-x86_64.AppImage
```

If you don't have `jq` and `curl` installed, go to
https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/releases/latest and fetch the latest
AppImage. Then:

```ShellSession
$ chmod +x ./conky-x86_64.AppImage
$ ./conky-x86_64.AppImage -C > ~/.conkyrc
$ ./conky-x86_64.AppImage
```

And that's it! [Check out the Wiki](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki) for more details on configuring Conky.

_Note_: To use the AppImage, you may need to install additional runtime libraries.
